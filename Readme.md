# **Decentralized Voting Application**

This project is a decentralized application (DApp) that utilizes the Ethereum blockchain to implement a voting system. It is implemented using the Solidity programming language to create the necessary smart contracts, and Truffle is used as the development environment.

## **Features**

- Users can create and vote in polls.
- Poll results are stored on the blockchain and cannot be tampered with.
- Only registered users can vote.

## **Installation**

1. Install Truffle: **`npm install -g truffle`**
2. Install the project dependencies: **`npm install`**
3. Compile the smart contracts: **`truffle compile`**
4. Migrate the contracts to the blockchain: **`truffle migrate`**

## **Usage**

To run the DApp, start a local development server: **`npm run start`**

Then, open the DApp in your web browser at **[http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000/)**.

## **Testing**

To run the test suite, use the following command: **`truffle test`**
